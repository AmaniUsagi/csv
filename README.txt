==========================================================Hey Georgina=================================================================

Everything works fine on the code. Only minor changes to be able to locate the csv on your pc
I used codeblocks IDE to do this work. If you'll use Visual studio find a way to make it work e.g (#include "stdafx.h") libs

1. Change the *ifstream* location (code line 12 to 14) to the location you have the csv file stored on your pc
2. Change the *ofstream* location (code line 136 to 137) to the location you want to print your new csv file

Optional additions to address number 4
3. You can make the code dynamic if you wish,to allow it to read new input data. It's KOmondi you know. he can do ask anything
4. You can also use vectors if you wish. Mimi ilinisumbua kidogo. I'm rusty
